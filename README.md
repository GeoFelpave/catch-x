# Catchment Explorer - Catch X
The CatchX web-platform has been designed by the University of Leeds and Earthwatch Europe to
allow universal access to cutting-edge scientific data in any river catchment globally. The most
appropriate datasets currently available have been selected and processed into 57,646 catchments.
The platform allows users, without needing specialist skills, to interrogate the datasets in their
catchment to visualise water balance information, explore trends and compare with other
catchments.

The projectâ€™s code was divided into different scripts corresponding to data preprocessing, data analysis and front end development.
This repository contains data preprocesing and data analysis code written in python. The project's methodology can be found [here:](https://earthwatch.org.uk/images/catchx/CatchXPreprocessingMethodology.pdf)  

The project was funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council (Grant number NE/P016812/1).
